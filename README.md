**Introduction**

The Viper Sample Project showcases a simple iOS application implemented using the Viper architecture. It demonstrates the separation of concerns and the interaction between different components of the Viper pattern, such as the View, Presenter, Interactor, and Router.

**Features**

This sample project includes the following features:

* Sign in with firebase
* Sign up with firebase 
* News list
* News detail

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.

**Requirements**

To run the Viper Sample Project, you need:

* Xcode 11.0 or later
* Swift 5.0 or later
* iOS 11.0 or later

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DevCrew-io/viper-sample-ios
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```
cd ViperDemo
open ViperDemo.xcodeproj
```
3. Build and run the project using the Xcode simulator or a connected device.

**Usage**
